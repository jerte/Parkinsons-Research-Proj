# Parkinsons Research Project

This was a semester long research project with the Dayan Lab for Neuroinformatics. 

The goal of this project was to use machine learning to predict if a given Parkinsons patient will remain cognitvely stable or experience cognitve decline. A secondary goal of this project was to identify regions that are importance to the cogntive effects of Parkinson's disease.

For my machine learning models, I used a SVM to classify patients as cognitvely stable or cognitvely declining. The prediction data was extracted from an intial MRI via FreeSurfer, a brain imaging software. I was given target areas to use as features, and certain values were extracted from these areas. I created three models, each with different sets of prediction data.
